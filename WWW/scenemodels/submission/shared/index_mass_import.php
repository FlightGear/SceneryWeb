<h1>Positions Automated Mass Import Submission Form</h1>

<p>
  <b>Foreword:</b> This automated mass import form goal is to ease the submission
  when submitter want to add a lot of shared models positions into FG Scenery database.
  <br />There are currently <?php $objects = count_objects(); echo number_format($objects, '0', '', ' ');?> objects in the database.
  Help us to make it more! Simply copy/paste the NEW content of your STG files below.
</p>
<p>
  Please read <a href="http://<?php echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']; ?>/contribute.php">this page</a>
  in order to understand what recommandations this script is looking for.
</p>
<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul class="warning">
    <li>Only add NEW objects or you will encounter errors!!</li>
    <li>
      Do not insert models not existing in the scenery objects database,
      nor OBJECT_SIGN, nor OBJECT_STATIC lines.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do <strong>NOT</strong> add forests or items linked to the landcover.
      Those have to be generated by the landmass layers! Will only be accepted
      the trees or equivalent natural boundaries within an airport.
    </li>
    <li>
      Also, please use the terrain shipped with FlightGear/Terrasync, and not
      any custom elevation model you may have installed/compiled.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do <strong>NOT</strong> add pitch or roll information issued by UFO in the
      latest version, it can't - yet - been taken into consideration. It's on
      our TODO list.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, add 100 lines maximum per submission!</li>
    <li>
      You can copy/paste objects positions coming from different STG files,
      it's not necessary to do as many submissions as STG files you're working on.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't forget to feed the Captcha, it's a mandatory item as well. Don't
      know what a Captcha is or what its goal is? Learn more
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">here</a>.
