Shared objects
==============
Features updates (by priority):
-------------------------------
- Ask the submitter to send his name in the forms (Would mandatory mail be sufficient?).
- Add pitch/roll so they can be, for instance, mass imported [can be added now, but they are not taken into account].
- The massive insertion script must use dollar quoting ($$) for ob_text, else ob_texts with , (such as square helipad) are not getting inserted.
- Add ob_text (edition, because in addition we would need Ajax), ob_country, add/update possibilities.
=> In update, beware that for the moment, we are replacing the current metadata, whatever
   it contains (including interesting obstruction information) by the name of the object.
   Can also serve as a comment (better than in a STG file).
- Add a possibility to switch from STG heading to true and inversely.
- Regionalise the maintainers : if lat/lon between x and y, send the validation mail to Jon, Martin or... else

Static objects
==============
After production:
=================
- The dos2unix has to be done before reading the files to check for input. This will avoid Windows CRLFs to make the cheking mishappen.
- Will have to authorize quotes into description/comments later on, because it is frequent in the english language cf PGSQL so-called Dollar-quoting, or from the PHP side.
- Code the possibility to add n times the same static model, such as statto needed in Iceland: specific models but that you can only find there. There's no need to make them shared.
- Use the PHP empty function in complement/instead of isset, where appropriate.
- Double check the path name to avoid someone to add an existing path (function nearly written at the end of functions.inc.php)
- Forbid the possibility to update a model with an existing path name and give the user to add an object from an existing static model (ie, multiple static instances).
- Feature: give the user a simple registration via the forms so he can be added to the authors table on a easy manner. However, this will need someone to validate this to avoid spammers.

Overall work:
=============
- Logging options
- Position with a preceeding 0 are sometimes causing troubles. Should be accepted and squashed.
- http://webdesignledger.com/tips/why-you-should-stop-using-captchas => try to find a more user-friendly solution
- Add a tcp/or so socket link between FG core and this script to import data directly into the DB!
  => Using HTTP API we could think of an export between ufo and fgs_objects scripts and between Blender and fgs_models scripts.
  => cf for instance the shapefiles download on the mapserver.
- Add a field in the static form where submitters can enter the generic models which get replaced.
- Let the maintainer the possibility to update fields in the submission checking form.
- Try to enhance the error management: it would be better, when possible, to show the user all errors rather than having him to send his models a few times to correct each error.
- Give the possibility to add .xml files for instance without a position/ac3d file. For instance a new strobe light, which is then referenced in the xml file of a 3D model.
- Improve statistics performance. Maybe create the stats only once a day and store them in some file, so we don't need to re-do all the math every time stats.php is loaded?

Terragear
=========
- Create a webtool "a la Terragear GUI" to generate scenery based on user inputs.
- Participate to the worldwide scenery generation, whether 810, 850, Corine...
