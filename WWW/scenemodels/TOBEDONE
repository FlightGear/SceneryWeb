Shared objects
==============
Bug/security fixing:
--------------------
- Check for every form & page the referring page & the value of the form submitting.
- In update, beware that for the moment, we are replacing the current metadata, whatever
  it contains (including interesting obstruction information) by the name of the object.

Features updates (by priority):
-------------------------------
- Review the names of the scripts to keep them coherent.
- Ask the submitter to send his name in the forms (Would mandatory mail be sufficient?).
- Add pitch/roll and offset data so they can be, for instance, mass imported.
- Just for fun, calculate when the object(s) will be available through Terrasync (12h30Z each day-emailtime).
- Enable maintainer to drop a comment.
- Add the model thumbnail when editing an object. In fact objectedit and submission edit must share common ideas !
- Add ob_text (edition, because in addition we would need Ajax), ob_country, add/update possibilities.
- Use Jquery lib for form checking & asynchronous queries.
- Take object "SIGN" into account.
- Take comments into account to merge them into the generated STG file (but how will you remove them ;-)
- Automate the altitude calculation (is there a FG server giving this online f(lat, long) ?).
- Automate the country calculation => Being done
- Add a possibility to switch from STG heading to true and inversely.
- Regionalise the maintainers : if lat/lon between x and y, send the validation mail to Jon, Martin or... else
- Add a tcp/or so socket link between FG core and this script to import data directly into the DB!

Static objects
==============

After production:
=================
- Is it really looking for already existing pathnames ?
- Will have to authorize quotes into description/comments later on, because it is frequent in the english language.
- We do still have /tmp/submission_ directories created and never deleted.
- Reformat textures to have a coherent picture size (precising the original dimensions) => thumbnail
- The multi form for PNG files seems not to display texture names on the index form.
- Put hangar stuff to /inc or something like that.

For later:
==========
- Keep the possibility of updating the static object, its thumbnail, or deleting it ?
- Logging options
- Add WebGL for public access as well (3D model viewer).
- Mass country update.
- Take roll/pitch into account.

Terragear
=========
- Create a webtool "a la Terragear GUI" to generate scenery based on user inputs.
- Generate WW scenery, whether 810, 850, Corine...
