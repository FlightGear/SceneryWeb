Shared objects
==============
Features updates (by priority):
-------------------------------
- Ask the submitter to send his name in the forms (Would mandatory mail be sufficient?).
- Add pitch/roll and offset data so they can be, for instance, mass imported.
- Enable maintainer to drop a comment.
- Add the model thumbnail when editing an object. In fact objectedit and submission edit must share common ideas !
- Add ob_text (edition, because in addition we would need Ajax), ob_country, add/update possibilities.
=> In update, beware that for the moment, we are replacing the current metadata, whatever
   it contains (including interesting obstruction information) by the name of the object.
   Can also serve as a comment (better than in a STG file).
- Automate the altitude calculation (is there a FG server giving this online f(lat, long) ?).
- psql -tA -F\ -c "SELECT ob_id, ST_X(wkb_geometry), ST_Y(wkb_geometry) FROM fgs_objects ORDER BY ob_tile" | ~/bin/fgelev | awk -F\: '{print "UPDATE fgs_objects SET ob_gndelev =" $2 " WHERE ob_id = " $1 ";"}'
UPDATE fgs_objects SET ob_gndelev = -0.021 WHERE ob_id = 512280;
- Automate the country calculation => Being done
- Add a possibility to switch from STG heading to true and inversely.
- Regionalise the maintainers : if lat/lon between x and y, send the validation mail to Jon, Martin or... else

Static objects
==============
After production:
=================
- Will have to authorize quotes into description/comments later on, because it is frequent in the english language cf PGSQL so-called Dollar-quoting, or from the PHP side.
- Keep the possibility of updating the static object, its thumbnail, or deleting it ?
- Use the PHP empty function in complement/instead of isset, where appropriate.

Overall work:
=============
- Review the intro page to add the latest models + objects stuff? Say what the scenery site + db is about, etc.
- Put emails as Bcc and to prevent spam replies, use no-reply@flightgear.org
- Enable comments fields to authorize 100 in width
- Enhance the pending submission stuff, so the maintainer can click on a URL to submit the model.
- Enhance the width of the site. May not show properly with all screen widths. Depends of pages, resolution, etc.
- Logging options
- Position with a preceding 0 are sometimes causing troubles. Should be accepted and squashed.
- Have an email account for spam abuse.
- http://webdesignledger.com/tips/why-you-should-stop-using-captchas => try to find a more user-friendly solution
- Add a tcp/or so socket link between FG core and this script to import data directly into the DB!
  => Using HTTP API we could think of an export between ufo and fgs_objects scripts and between Blender and fgs_models scripts.
  => cf for instance the shapefiles download on the mapserver.
- Add a field in the static form where submitters can enter the generic models which get replaced.
- Let the maintainer the possibility to update fields in the submission checking form.
- Try to enhance the error management: it would be better, when possible, to show the user all errors rather than having him to send his models a few times to correct each error.
- Give the possibility to add .xml files for instance without a position/ac3d file. For instance a new strobe light, which is then referenced in the xml file of a 3D model.

Terragear
=========
- Create a webtool "a la Terragear GUI" to generate scenery based on user inputs.
- Participate to the worldwide scenery generation, whether 810, 850, Corine...
