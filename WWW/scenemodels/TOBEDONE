Shared objects
==============
Bug/security fixing:
--------------------
- Check for every form & page the referring page & the value of the form submitting.
- Sanitize comments +lat/long content (Javascript + PHP stuff and strip tags). More checkings in the update script.

Features updates (by priority):
-------------------------------
- Review the names of the scripts to keep them coherent.
- Ask the submitter to send his name in the forms (Would mandatory mail be sufficient?).
- Implement if submitting an already existing object (function already written).
- Postpone the Javascript checks to the effectiv submission of the object/model (Julien).
- Add pitch/roll data.
- Just for fun, calculate when the object(s) will be available through Terrasync (12h30Z each day-emailtime).
- Enable maintainer to drop a comment.
- Shows the object position when selected (map when adding...).
- Add the model thumbnail when editing an object. In fact objectedit and submission edit must share common ideas !
- Add ob_text (edition, because in addition we would need Ajax), ob_country, add/update possibilities.
- When there is an error with the captcha, an error page is being presented, containing a "Go back ..."
  link - but when clicked - all values have to be re-entered from scratch. Preserving the entered values so
  submitters just have to re-enter a captcha phrase would be highly beneficial.
- Use Jquery lib for form checking & asynchronous queries.
- Take object "SIGN" into account.
- Take comments into account to merge them into the generated STG file (but how will you remove them ;-)
- Automate the altitude calculation (is there a FG server giving this online f(lat, long) ?)
- Regionalise the maintainers : if lat/lon between x and y, send the validation mail to Jon, Martin or... else
- Add a tcp/or so socket link between FG core and this script to import data directly into the DB!

Static objects
==============
- Captcha
- Reformat textures to have a coherent picture size (precising the original dimensions) => thumbnail
- What about mo/contributor - mo author. How to distinguish both ? Insertion into objects/models...
- Only if static : the two-letter country code starts with "ob_", this goes into our objects table (fgs_objects). For shared models it won't go anywhere. Really think we should
  have a geographical request for that, to update all objects in DB at once... and keep stats coherent.

For later:
==========
- Do more checkings PHP PREGs when we have more time.
- The usual (suspects ;-)) 3D model feeders are entered in the DB. How to use their email and validation scheme? => JS : if the author is known, the maintainer and email field should disappear.
- Keep the possibility of updating the static object, its thumbnail, or deleting it ?
- Logging options
- Add WebGL for public access as well (3D model viewer).
- Take Roll/pitch into account.

Terragear
=========
- Create a webtool "Ã  la Terragear GUI" to generate scenery based on user inputs.
- Generate WW scenery, whether 810, 850, Corine...
