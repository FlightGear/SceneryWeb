Shared objects
==============
Bug/security fixing:
--------------------
- Check for every form & page the referring page & the value of the form submitting.
- Sanitize comments +lat/long content (Javascript + PHP stuff and strip tags). More checkings in the update script.
- In the update form the (eventually former) Object family and model name should be selected
  by default.

Features updates (by priority):
-------------------------------
- Review the names of the scripts to keep them coherent.
- Ask the submitter to send his name in the forms (Would mandatory mail be sufficient?).
- Implement if submitting an already existing object (function already written).
- Postpone the Javascript checks to the effectiv submission of the object/model (Julien).
- Just for fun, calculate when the object(s) will be available through Terrasync (12h30Z each day-emailtime).
- Enable maintainer to drop a comment.
- Shows the object position when selected (map when adding...).
- Add ob_text (edition, because in addition we would need Ajax), ob_country, add/update possibilities.
- When there is an error with the captcha, an error page is being presented, containing a "Go back ..."
  link - but when clicked - all values have to be re-entered from scratch. Preserving the entered values so
  submitters just have to re-enter a captcha phrase would be highly beneficial.
- Use Jquery lib for form checking & asynchronous queries.
- Take object "SIGN" into account.
- Take comments into account to merge them into the generated STG file (but how will you remove them ;-)
- Automate the altitude calculation (is there a FG server giving this online f(lat, long) ?)
- Regionalise the maintainers : if lat/lon between x and y, send the validation mail to Jon, Martin or... else
- Add a tcp/or so socket link between FG core and this script to import data directly into the DB!

Static objects
==============
- Dos2Unix of the files, to prevent ^M, eg in .XML files
- Do more checkings on the form site (JS) + PHP PREGs when we have more time.
- Have a page showing the whole submission, so the maintainer has a clear view of what has been submitted, with an AC3D plugin.
- User should be redirected to the model_edit script to come when trying to update a model.
- Don't put JPEG thumbnail into the .tar.gz
- Note, the two-letter country code starts with "ob_", this goes into our objects table (fgs_objects), containing
  the position whereas the bare model, no matter if it's shared or static, goes into the models table (fgs_objects). ==> DONE
- There are not always textures (AC3D file with simple colors) and there can be multiple textures. ==> DONE
- Use the fgs_position_requests table to store the requests BEFORE they are submitted into the production table. The tricky part is that, when inserting the model into DB, a model id
  is returned which is - then - used to insert the model position into fgs_objects. It could be that the second request (position) is left "blank" in the first part of the process (when
  the request is stored into the fgs_position_requests table, and then added only once the model is validated (i.e. : we first send the request into fgs_models, retrieve the number, and then
  reprocess the second request with the id returned by the DB.)
- Captcha ==> DONE
- Logging options ==> DONE WITH THE NEW INTERFACE

For later:
==========
- Keep the possibility of updating the static object, its thumbnail, or deleting it ?
- The usual (suspects ;-)) 3D model feeders are entered in the DB. How to use their email and validation scheme? => JS : if the author is known, the maintainer and email field should disappear.

Mapserver
=========
- Renew (see Gijs comment) the object click function on the maps to retrieve the information on the selected object. Seems to be broken since a mapserver update.

Terragear
=========
- Create a webtool "Ã  la Terragear GUI" to generate scenery based on user inputs.
