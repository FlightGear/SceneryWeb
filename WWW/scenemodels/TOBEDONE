Shared objects
==============
Bug/security fixing:
--------------------
- Check for every form & page the referring page & the value of the form submitting.
- In update, beware that for the moment, we are replacing the current metadata, whatever
  it contains (including interesting obstruction information) by the name of the object.

Features updates (by priority):
-------------------------------
- Review the names of the scripts to keep them coherent.
- Ask the submitter to send his name in the forms (Would mandatory mail be sufficient?).
- Add pitch/roll and offset data so they can be, for instance, mass imported.
- Just for fun, calculate when the object(s) will be available through Terrasync (12h30Z each day-emailtime).
- Enable maintainer to drop a comment.
- Add the model thumbnail when editing an object. In fact objectedit and submission edit must share common ideas !
- Add ob_text (edition, because in addition we would need Ajax), ob_country, add/update possibilities.
- Use Jquery lib for form checking & asynchronous queries.
- Take object "SIGN" into account.
- Take comments into account to merge them into the generated STG file (but how will you remove them ;-)
- Automate the altitude calculation (is there a FG server giving this online f(lat, long) ?).
- Automate the country calculation => Being done
- Add a possibility to switch from STG heading to true and inversely.
- Regionalise the maintainers : if lat/lon between x and y, send the validation mail to Jon, Martin or... else
- Add a tcp/or so socket link between FG core and this script to import data directly into the DB!

Static objects
==============
Before production:
==================
- I usually don't submit the "ob_elevoffset". According to the table
  schema it defaults to NULL and we should leave it this way and _not_
  write a zero.  Checking a NULL in the DB is _very_ fast, because it a
  boolean-type operation, but checking a zero always requires to
  interpret the result and forces a comparison to be made.
  Therefore it there's no elevation offset, please either write NULL - or
  simply omit the field.
- I still tend to write the country into every, but that's non-critical.
- Vic's model didn't have a comment, correct ?
- Please don't quote numerical values, only strings, otherwise that'll
  likely lead to errors.  This is your position insert:
  INSERT INTO fgsoj_objects (ob_text, wkb_geometry, ob_gndelev, ob_elevoffset, ob_heading, ob_model, ob_group)
  VALUES ('', ST_PointFromText('POINT(-2.02942626 49.1645792)', 4326), '-0.3293', '0', '276', '2434', '1') RETURNING ob
And this would be mine:
  INSERT INTO fgs_objects (ob_text, wkb_geometry, ob_gndelev, ob_heading, ob_country, ob_model, ob_group)
  VALUES ('Test', ST_PointFromText('POINT(-2.02942626 49.1645792)', 4326), -0.3293, 276, 'gb', 2434, 1);
- the "don't quote numerical values also applies to the "mo_author" and "mo_shared" columns in the first INSERT.
- fix return_values.

After production:
=================
- Reformat textures to have a coherent picture size (precising the original dimensions) => thumbnail
- Only if static : the two-letter country code starts with "ob_", this goes into our objects table (fgs_objects). For shared models it won't go anywhere. Really think we should
  have a geographical request for that, to update all objects in DB at once... and keep stats coherent.

For later:
==========
- Keep the possibility of updating the static object, its thumbnail, or deleting it ?
- Logging options
- Add WebGL for public access as well (3D model viewer).
- Take roll/pitch into account.

Terragear
=========
- Create a webtool "a la Terragear GUI" to generate scenery based on user inputs.
- Generate WW scenery, whether 810, 850, Corine...
