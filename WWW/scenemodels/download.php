<h1>Scenery Downloads</h1>
<p>
  In order to have the latest up-to-date scenery, it is <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong> to use <strong>Terrasync</strong> included with FlightGear to download automatically the scenery when you are flying.</p>
<p>
  However, for any reason, you still can download the files here:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="scenery_download.php">Scenery download</a>: contains the scenery ground but <strong>the objects are not up-to-date</strong></li>
    <li><a href="objects_download.php">Scenery objects download</a>: contains <strong>only</strong> the latest up-to-date objects</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Currently a global file is also available <a href="/download/GlobalObjects.tgz">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  A collection of shared models can be downloaded <a href="/download/SharedModels.tgz">here</a>.<br/>
  (This file is <strong>*REQUIRED*</strong> if you want to see all the objects, and should be unpacked in your FGROOT directory)
